# JavaScript Part 1:
1. "values added: 20" is printed by line 9.
2. "final result: 20" is printed by line 13.
3. "values added: 20" is printed by line 9.
4. The code returns an error in line 13 because result is declared as a let variable type which means that its scope is only limited to inside the if statement. Line 13 is outside of the if statement so result is not defined in its scope and an error is returned.
5. The code returns an error because result is declared as a const variable type which means that its value cannot be changed after declaration. In line 7, the code attempts to assign result to num1 + num2 which causes an error in the code.
